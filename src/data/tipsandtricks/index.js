    subTitle: 'Only works with enough stamina regeneration and buying pots.',
    desc: `There is a way to make possible runnning auto attack for the whole day and get 30-50 scrolls daily. In order for this to work you will need at least:

<b>*</b> Buy Auto Attack (Limited > Benefits Packs > Auto Attack).
<b>*</b> Buying stamina pots daily in the merchant (Get at least 10x20+ and 5-7x50+).
<b>*</b> Overall stamina regeneration between 80-95%.
<b>*</b> Recommended: Spare smartphone to run auto attack the whole day without deterioring your main phone. Samsung sugested as they have a Game Option that can dim the screen.

<b>Steps</b>:
<b>1.</b> Set the <b>Monster Levels</b> Rank 30 to Rank 30. (Level 30 monsters only.)
<b>2.</b> Set 1 <b>March Queue Limit</b>.
<b>3.</b> Set <b>Queue Info</b> (A) with a troop formation having Cavalry/Infantry and your main backline (Mages/Archers). Example: 120k T13 Cavalry, 20k T1 Cavalry, rest 130k T13 Mages.
<b>4.</b> Set <b>Furthest Marching Route</b> to <b>Unlimited</b>.
<b>5.</b> Set <b>Stamina items</b> to 10-15+ x20 and 5-7+ x50 stamina pots.
<b>6.</b> Make sure you have the <b>Auto Attack Weekly Card Left</b> higher than 0s.
<b>7.</b> Start Auto Attack.

I've been doing this for at least 2 years, before camel changed the drop rate I was getting 50 scrolls daily without spending all the stamina pots I bought daily.

<b>Where to get Stamina Regeneration?</b>
<b>* Equipments:</b> Check the Equipment Simulator and select any Monster preset here: <a href="https://waotools.com/equipment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equipment/Enhancements</a>.
<b>* Enhancements:</b> Weapon has Stamina Regeneration Enhance.
<b>* Emblems:</b> Power Emblem.
<b>* Artifacts:</b> Boot of Speeds Tier 4.
<b>* Lord Skills:</b> Development > Stamina Recovery 1 and 2.
<b>* Achievements:</b> Plunderer
<b>* College:</b> Development > Physique 1 and 2.

<b>2.</b> Start healing at least 1h - 2h and ask for your allies to hit the help button to reduce the time. If you can't be online much, make time shorter until you can spend the daily Help Limit.
<b>3.</b> Continue the process until reset. You will get your daily Help Limit again.
